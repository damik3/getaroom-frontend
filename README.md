# getaroom-frontend

Web platform for renting rooms or apartments. Part of an undergrad course homework. Front end implemented with Angular 9. Backend with Java Spring Boot.

Users can be either lodgers, owners or admins. Lodgers can search and rent rooms, owners can also add a room for renting and admins can also edit every other users' info and rooms. 

Role based authentication is done with JSON Web Tokens and the Client-Server communication is encrypted with HTTPS.
